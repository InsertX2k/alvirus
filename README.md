## A useful pro tip: <br/>
This virus creates a new user named "**Enterprise**" in your local **SYSTEM**, If you want to escape from the virus you should guess the password of it. <br/>

## FAQ: <br/>
**Are you a cybercriminal?** <br/>
Don't be foolish, of course I am not a cybercriminal, that's why I posted the source code of my virus here, **I just care about cyber security.** <br/>
**How do I compile this into a working exe file?:** <br/>
Use either `pyinstaller` or `py2exe`, but I strongly recommend `pyinstaller` for many reasons. <br/>
For batch versions of this source code, use a tool named `Bat To Exe Converter by Fatih Kodak`. <br/>
